## Sine Wave Demo

<img src="images/dsPIC33A_Curiosity.png" alt="Project Demo" width="700"/>

# Summary

This code example demonstrates how to generate a 100 Hz sine wave without CPU intervention using the DMA and DAC peripherals of a dsPIC33A device.  

The DMA peripheral will utilize the Capture/Compare event generated by the SCCP module to iterate and place values from a 256 point sine lookup table to a DAC peripheral for output.

Omitted configurations are default values set by MCC Melody. 

#### 1. DMA Melody Driver's DMA Channel 0 Settings:

|Setting|Value|Explanation|
|---|----|---|
|Enable Channel|False| Starts with channel disabled since it needs to be enabled after SCCP1 in PWM mode is initialized in the main.c.|
|Enable Reload|True|The registers are reloaded to previous values at the next start.|
|Transfer Mode|Repeated One-Shot|This allows the DMA to iterate and transfer data one value per event until it reaches the transfer count.|
|Trigger Sources|SCCP1 Timer/OC/IC Event|This checks for an of the SCCP1 capture/compare event. (Triggered by running SCCP1 in PWM mode) |
|Source Address Mode|Incremented|Increments the Source Address value by the Data Size|
|Source Address|0|This is set within the application code to use the address of the first sine wave point.|
|Destination Address Mode|Unchanged|This means the destination address will not be affected by the DMA iteration.|
|Destination Address|0|This is set within the application code.|
|Data Size|32 bit|Sets that transaction size.|
|Transfer Count|0x100|The number of times to iterate in one-shot. (256 points)|

|Setting|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|---|

|Requested Frequency (Hz)|25600|This value is calculated based on the number of points to iterate multiplied by the expected output frequency. *Continued explanation in the "PWM Melody driver's requested frequency explanation" below.|
|Sync/Trigger|Sync|This is set since PWM is not triggered by any external interrupt.|
|Interrupt Driven|Disabled|This is disabled so the ISR does not impact the DMA functionality.|
|PWM PLIB Selector|SCCP1|This generates a capture/compare event being used by the DMA driver.|

## PWM Melody driver's requested frequency explanation

The PWM Melody driver (not hardware peripheral) is being used to trigger the SCCP1 Output Compare event only.

With the DMA module configured to use the "SCCP1 Timer/OC/IC Event", only the Output Compare/Input Capture event will trigger the DMA to run not the Timer callback event as the description may imply. *The selections description may be updated for newer versions of the DMA driver.

The SCCP1 capture/compare event (being used as the DMA trigger to update the DAC value) occurs on every falling edge of the PWM. The frequency we select in the PWM driver in Hz represents the number of SCCP1 events per second. Since the sine lookup table is defined, the SCCP1 event needs to occur 256 times per 1 Hz of the expected output to represent the Correct period. This boils down to a multiplication problem:

PWM Frequency (Hz) = Points Length (Sine wave table Length) * Required Output Frequency (Hz)

For example, if there is a need to lower the frequency of the sine wave output to 10 Hz with a 256 point sine wave lookup table updating the PWM to use a frequency of 2560 Hz should represent that output.

**There is however a hardware limit for the PWM requested frequency and the SCCP's interaction with the DMA driver**

In testing here are the following values for the Min and Max frequencies for PWM to trigger output compare events for sine wave outputs:

|Requested PWM Frequency|Sine wave output frequency|
|---------------------|----------------------|
|25.6 Hz (Near Minimum requested Frequency)| 0.1 Hz|
|256 Hz|1 Hz|
|2560 Hz|10 Hz|
|25600 Hz| 100 Hz|
|256000 Hz| 1 kHz|
|2560000 Hz| 9.8 kHz|
|25600000 Hz|78 kHz|
|100000000 Hz (Maximum Requested Frequency)|97 kHz|
